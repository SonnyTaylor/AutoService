//! # Models Module
//!
//! This module defines the data structures used throughout AutoService.
//! It provides comprehensive models for system information, hardware details, installed
//! programs, tools, and scripts. All structures are designed to be serializable and
//! deserializable using Serde, enabling seamless data exchange between the Rust backend
//! and the frontend.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **System Information**: Detailed hardware and software system data
//! - **Hardware Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, network, GPU, and sensor information
//! - **Program Management**: Structures for tracking installed programs and their metadata
//! - **Tool Integration**: Models for external tools and their status
//! - **Script Management**: Support for various script types and execution tracking
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! These models are primarily used for:
//! - Collecting and displaying system information
//! - Managing program installations and launches
//! - Tracking tool availability and status
//! - Executing and monitoring scripts
//!
//! All structures implement `Debug`, `Clone`, `Serialize`, and `Deserialize` traits
//! for maximum flexibility in data handling.
