# Contributing to AutoService

We welcome contributions! This guide will help you get started.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Report Bugs** - Found an issue? Open a GitHub issue
- **Suggest Features** - Have an idea? Create a feature request
- **Write Documentation** - Help others understand the project

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Development Environment

Follow the [Development Setup](dev-setup.md) guide.

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `refactor/` - Code improvements

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Follow existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic

### 4. Test Your Changes

```powershell
# Frontend
pnpm test

# Backend
cargo test

# Python
python -m pytest runner/

# Full app
pnpm tauri dev
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to GitHub
2. Create a Pull Request with a clear description
3. Link any related issues
4. Wait for review and address feedback

## Code Style

### JavaScript

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use semicolons (automatic with most editors)
- Use `const` by default, `let` if reassignment needed

Example:

```javascript
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;

function handleUserInput(value) {
  const processed = value.trim();
  return processed;
}
```

### Rust

- Follow Rust conventions (rustfmt automatically)
- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Use PascalCase for types and structs
- Add documentation comments (///)

Example:

```rust
/// Calculate the sum of two numbers
fn calculate_sum(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

### Python

- Follow PEP 8
- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Add type hints where practical
- Document functions with docstrings

Example:

```python
def calculate_total(items: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the total of a list of items.
    
    Args:
        items: List of integers to sum
        
    Returns:
        The sum of all items
    """
    return sum(items)
```
