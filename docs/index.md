# AutoService Documentation

Welcome to the AutoService documentation! This is your complete guide to using and developing AutoService, a Windows diagnostic toolkit built with Tauri (Rust backend) + vanilla JavaScript frontend.

## What is AutoService?

AutoService is a portable, USB-friendly Windows diagnostic and maintenance toolkit designed for computer repair technicians and power users. It automates cleanup tasks, runs diagnostics, executes stress tests, and generates comprehensive reportsâ€”all from a single executable.

### Key Features

- **Automation First**: Orchestrate tools like AdwCleaner, BleachBit, SFC, DISM, smartctl, HeavyLoad, and FurMark with minimal clicks
- **Run Queue Builder**: Build an ordered list of maintenance tasks directly from the UI
- **Portable & Extensible**: Add your own programs and scripts without code changes
- **System Diagnostics**: Comprehensive hardware and OS information collection
- **Component Testing**: Test cameras, microphones, speakers, displays, and network connectivity
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate technical and customer-friendly reports

!!! info "Portable Design"
AutoService is designed to run from USB drives alongside a `data/` folder. Keep the executable and data folder together for full functionality.

!!! warning "System Requirements"
AutoService requires Windows 10 or later and administrator privileges for most diagnostic tasks.
